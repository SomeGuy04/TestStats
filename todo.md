GUI (with tkinter)

chunk based read and write(ability to save answers)

classes.py : using something more ram-friendly than qmap in functions

main.py : saving a test (not only answers) and continuing from where you left

main.py : able to redo a saved test ( not entering everything manually again)

main.py : saving answeres of a source (similar to upper idea)

main.py : learing mode : remind the user to check answer anyway
